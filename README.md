# Glyphs-FontForgeImport

Importer for FontForge (SFD) files in Glyphs.

I wanted to be able to quickly look at FontForge files without going through the hassle to install FontForge on macOS, so I hacked this little plugin. It is not perfect yet, but imports the glyph outlines well enough.

Let me know if something is missing.

You can start the import via `File > Import > FontForge File...`.
